# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Model Deployment

## Description

The "Airline Passenger Satisfaction Model Deployment" is an innovative project that leverages machine learning to enhance the airline passenger experience. This project is designed to predict and improve passenger satisfaction by utilizing predictive models and deploying them into real-world airline operations.

**Key Features:**

- **Predictive Analytics**: The project employs advanced machine learning techniques, including a Random Forest model, to predict passenger satisfaction levels based on a variety of factors, such as flight amenities, service quality, and customer feedback.

- **Real-time Deployment**: The predictive models, including the Random Forest model, are deployed in real-time within the airline's operational environment. This means that actionable insights and recommendations can be provided to airline staff and crew during flights, allowing for immediate improvements.

- **Enhanced Passenger Experience**: By analyzing data and passenger feedback, the project aims to identify areas where the airline can make improvements to enhance passenger satisfaction. These improvements may include adjusting in-flight services, optimizing seat assignments, and more.

- **Web Interface for Passenger Input**: The project includes a user-friendly web interface created with Flask that allows passengers to provide input regarding their flight experience. Passengers can easily submit feedback and preferences, which are then integrated into the predictive models.

- **Model Persistence**: The Random Forest model, once trained, is saved as a pickle file, ensuring its availability for real-time predictions without the need for retraining.

- **Data-driven Decision Making**: The project promotes data-driven decision-making within the airline industry, enabling airlines to proactively address passenger concerns and preferences.

- **User-friendly Interface**: The deployed system offers a user-friendly interface for airline staff and passengers. Passengers can provide feedback, while airline staff can access predictions and recommendations during flights.
